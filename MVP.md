# MVP Definition: Voice-OpenClaw Bridge v2

## Overview

**Product Name:** Voice-OpenClaw Bridge v2  
**Version:** MVP v1.0  
**Target Date:** Sprint 4 Completion  
**Goal:** Deliver a functional bidirectional voice interface that enables hands-free interaction with OpenClaw.

---

## What is the MVP?

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a **working voice bridge** that allows users to:
1. Speak naturally to OpenClaw
2. Receive spoken responses (not text reads)
3. Experience seamless turn-taking (no typing required)

The MVP is **not** a polished consumer product. It's a functional prototype that proves the core concept and can be used daily by early adopters.

---

## MVP Objectives

### Primary Objective
> Enable natural voice interaction with OpenClaw where users speak requests and hear responses, with intelligent filtering to avoid speaking internal processing.

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Hands-free operation** - No typing, no clicking, voice-only
2. **Real-time response** - Under 2 seconds from speech end to TTS start
3. **Accurate filtering** - Never speak tool calls, thinking, or internal processing
4. **Interruption capability** - User can cut off TTS with new input
5. **Session continuity** - Remember context across commands
